# Design Patterns - Composite Pattern

Composite pattern is used where we need to treat a group of objects in similar way as a single object. 
Composite pattern composes objects in term of a tree structure to represent part as well as whole hierarchy. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern creates a tree structure of group of objects.

This pattern creates a class that contains group of its own objects. This class provides ways to modify its group of same objects.
