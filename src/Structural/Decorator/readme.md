# Design Patterns - Decorator Pattern

Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure.
 
This type of design pattern comes under **structural pattern** as this pattern acts as a wrapper to existing class.

This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality keeping class methods signature intact.
